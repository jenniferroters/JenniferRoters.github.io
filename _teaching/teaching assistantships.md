For these courses, I have been required to be familiar with all the course material listed (i.e.: readings, lecture materials, assignments, exams, etc.); however, each role had different aspects that I was responsible for. 

Introductory Research Design and Statistics
======

For this course, as a Teaching Assistant, I have led seminars both online and in person, taken up and graded assignments and examination, and proctored examinations. As a Course Coordinator organized and arranged deferred examinations (both online and in person), fielded emails/messages regarding course content, proctored examinations (online), arranged Teaching Assistant coverage for additional office hours, and other course duties as required. Lastly, I also completed a Teaching Apprenticeship where I covered two separate topics in the course and prepared 2 different seminar assignments and examination questions that coincided with the lectures as approved by the instructor. This was delivered over 6 hours of class time across 2 sections of the course, in person.
