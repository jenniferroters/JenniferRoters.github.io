Quantitative Methods in Social Science Research
======

This Masters level course focused on how to analyze quantitative data in behaviour analysis, with particular attention given to the opportunities and challenges provided by the use of SPSS. The main objective of this course was to learn how to think more critically and reflectively about data processing and analysis in behaviour analysis. The specific focus in the course was the fundamental statistical concepts that support the application of statistics to research along with the special challenges in applying these concepts via SPSS. Topics covered included:

* descriptive statistics and their utility in evaluating assumptions
* basic group comparison procedures
* bivariate statistics 
* introduction to the General Linear Model
* a general-purpose rubric for analyzing experimental and correlational designs

In the scheduled combination lecture/labs, students had a variety of opportunities to actively participate in discussions related to the analytic process. Labs provided actual hands-on experience in using SPSS to carry out statistical analyses. This course introduced the technical aspects of conducting quantitative research, from data processing to statistical analysis and reporting findings to others. As well, the course aided students in developing a critical perspective on how research is conducted from the quantitative perspective, prepared students to conduct research and to be intelligent consumers of research when applied to practice in behaviour analysis.

My role: I ran office hours, marked assignments/exams, and provided support to students regarding homework and assignments/exams.
