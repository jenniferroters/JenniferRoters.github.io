Back from the Borderline: The impact of insecure attachment and childhood trauma (interview with personality disorder specialist Jen Roters)
======

Original episode description: Among the symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD), insecurity in one's sense of self and relationships is often seen as a core feature. Fearing abandonment, alternating between idealizing and devaluing others (splitting), and rapidly shifting between moods, people who identify with BPD seem to share some of the basic elements of individuals with what's known as an "insecure attachment style." In this episode, I had the opportunity to sit down with Jen Roters, a doctoral candidate of psychology at Brock University, where she has dedicated over ten years of her life to the study of childhood adversity related to attachment and personality disorder development.
