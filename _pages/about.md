I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Northern British Columbia. I completed my PhD in Psychology at Brock University as a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholar (Vanier CGS) awarded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). I work in the field of forensic psychological research primarily, focusing on childhood adversities (such as abuse and neglect), and how this affects attachment to others, the ability to be mindful, and the resulting personality outcomes (such as Borderline and Psychopathic personality traits). I also research in the areas of sexual offenders and teaching statistical concepts. I work with a range of populations (adults, children, clinical, forensic, and normative) and work under a knowledge translation lens. 

My experience ranges from theoretical work to research/statistical modelling to applied settings such as teaching, individual and group therapy, assessment and clinical supervision. I hold a MA in Clinical/Counselling Psychology from LaSalle University (Specialization in Professional Counselling) as well as a MA in Social/Personality Psychology at Brock University while holding a Canada Graduate Scholarships-Master's (CGS M) awarded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). I also am licensed with the College of Registered Psychotherapists. My broad range of experience reflects my passion for the breadth and depth of psychology and reinforces my helping others philosophy.
